the link...
    like a graph
a link with direction & type
    hypervector
        a link with direction type & value
            {
                dir?
                from
                to
                type
                val
            } 
    
with today's social media, the personal experience is rooted in a global context
    global/public should be derived from personal connections
        no true global 

today, a domain, without technical effort, is basically a filesystem like host with its own special filetype: HTML
    domains could & should be doorways for deeper...
        but remain elegantly simple
    
    filesystems are trees
        trees are a type of graph
            graphs... the social graph...
    
    what if a domain, by default, was more than a rigid opaque tree
        but a dynamic, queryable graph 
            a demonstration of such a systems power is that it can replicate the tree based structure but not other way around
            a graph contain many tree like structures, or just be a single filesystem like tree
    
    the problems
    a solution must
        - reduce surface area of the bullshit & makes the good great    

    problem w/ API oriented host: 
        - too much diversity, silos
        - limited reliability        
        - sync overhead, start w/ polling... ugh
        - end up rebuilding a shitty database in clients
        solution : graph database oriented host
            - everything is queryable reliably
                - existing APIs can be easily integrated
            - distributed schemas w/ lenses
            - graph database backend: AOL backed storage, CRDT primitives, builtin p2p networking & sync
        
    problem w/ HTML oriented host: 
        - the data of the content is easily lost due to tight coupling with presentation
            - the complexity arising from ever expressive presentation requirements 
                -> tyranny of few browsers
                    - websites second class citizens relative to apps, can only exist within an app (most often a browser)
        solution :
            - the graph data is the host, presentation is a concern of applications
            - instead of relying on monolothic presentation apps like browsers (chromium, wtf)
                - different apps for differnt ways of dealing with the data

    problem w/ a Browser oriented web:
        - stifles innovation
            - innovator's solution principle on when to focus on open standardization vs closed vertical integration
        - ossification, HTML limited in some way? maybe in 7 years if google & microsoft & mozilla all give the go
            - "by your leave"
        solution : an open-ended system w/ ground rules for competition 
            - 

    problem w/ the "semantic" oriented host
        - the horrors...
        soltuion :
            - 
    
    problem w/ server oriented host
        solution: p2p sdwan
    
    

    the solution:
        - graph data layer + application layer
        - creates a seperate data market & app market, each an arena for competing for the individual 
            - data market
                - make your data more available
                - expand your access 
                    - expose existing web data (fb, tw, wiki, hackernews, github, yt, ig, etc)
            - app market
                - job-to-be-done specific tools for interacting with your data
        - open-ended, distributed, fast,

        feature: compat w/ existing web via wasm 
            -
        
        feature: offline-first collab

        feature: 
     
            

    /// no
from html as host for css + js (wherein js will have APIs for html & css)
to c as host for js (wherein js will have APIs)
    like html, you can get by with just C.
        unlike html as a host, you can do everything concievable in a C host

    taking an HTML file, how would a similar such C file look like
